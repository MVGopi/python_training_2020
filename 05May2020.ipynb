      "    This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to\n",

      "    the pattern and the strings being processed can contain null bytes and\n",
      "    characters outside the US ASCII range.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.\n",
      "    Most ordinary characters, like \"A\", \"a\", or \"0\", are the simplest\n",
      "    regular expressions; they simply match themselves.  You can\n",
      "    concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The special characters are:\n",
      "        \".\"      Matches any character except a newline.\n",
      "        \"^\"      Matches the start of the string.\n",
      "        \"$\"      Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at\n",

      "        \"*\"      Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.\n",
      "                 Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.\n",
      "        \"+\"      Matches 1 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.\n",
